 ### MVVM Architecture : 

MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle "Keeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage".

#### MVVM components : 

* **Entity:** Annotated class that describes a database table when working with Room.

 * **SQLite database:** On device storage. The Room persistence library creates and maintains this database for you.

 * **DAO:** Data access object. A mapping of SQL queries to functions. When you use a DAO, you call the methods, and Room takes care of the rest.

 * **Room database:** Simplifies database work and serves as an access point to the underlying SQLite database (hides SQLiteOpenHelper). The Room database uses the DAO to issue queries to the SQLite database.

 * **Repository:** Used to manage multiple data sources.

 * **ViewModel:** Acts as a communication center between the Repository (data) and the UI. The UI no longer needs to worry about the origin of the data. ViewModel instances survive Activity/Fragment recreation.

 * **LiveData:** A data holder class that can be observed. Always holds/caches the latest version of data, and notifies its observers when data has changed.
 
 
### Retrofit : 
<a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/"><b>Retrofit</b></a> is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square. The library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.
